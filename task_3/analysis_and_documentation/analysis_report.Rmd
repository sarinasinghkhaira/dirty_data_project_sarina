Bird with the most individual sightings


```{r}
# Make a table of common, scientific and abbreviated species names
seabirds_species <- seabirds_full_clean %>% 
  select(species_scientific_name,

Bird with the highest total count

```{r}
seabirds_full_clean %>%
  group_by(species_abbreviation) %>%
  summarise(sightings_count = n(),
            total_count = sum(count)) %>%

Bird with the highest total count above latitude -30
```{r}
seabirds_full_clean %>%
  filter(lat > -30) %>%
  group_by(species_abbreviation) %>%
  summarise(sightings_count = n(),
